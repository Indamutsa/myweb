                        <h4>Contentment in the Kingdom of God</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <h6>Contentment for some is defined in terms of possessions: mansions, cars, fame, position, status quo,
                            beautiful girlfriends or boyfriends, owning successful businesses and so on. Some also think
                            they would have been content if they would have been born in certain parts of the world, family
                            with this or that race, or if they were born of supernatural aptitude like Einstein or Solomon
                            or Beethoven! All these things last for a small period and then it's gone and none remembers
                            it. They all vanish, becoming dust. The ever wiser person ever lived on this planet is supposed
                            to be a king called Solomon, and he said all that we toil up under the sun is simply chasing
                            after the wind, all vanity!.</h6>
                        <h6>If these things were deserving what we have attributed unto it so far, famous artists, politicians,
                            scientists, businesspersons, athletes would not commit suicide. Why? Because all that a human
                            can ever desire they get hold of in this life. They live a utopia life as some thinks but still
                            they end desperately, still not satisfied. Jesus said to Peter when he asked him what they will
                            get back as compensation for all they left back, and He told him he will get a hundredfold of
                            what he left and also get a splendid everlasting life. But as we scrutinize his life, we never
                            saw him with a hundred boats, or with a hundred fishing industries, or with his business expanding
                            in hundred countries. All twelve apostles lived in dire circumstances and died miserably, reason
                            why they are called martyrs, that was nothing of prestige. No one lived with his family, they
                            were just wandering off hills and valleys preaching the kingdom of God to the people who looked
                            like sheep without a shepherd and when we inquire if they were content with that life, they thought
                            nothing on earth could be compared of the treasure they had. One of them said things on earth
                            are like Shit compared to the glory bestowed on them
                        </h6>
                        <h6>Then what was Jesus really talking about? According to Experince and research: abundance of possessions
                            only brings sorrow, fear and worry. And the bible says that the love of money (things) is the
                            root of every evil. So then where does contentment come from ? My Pastor preached in the morning
                            that it comes from focusing on Jesus. Psychologists says it comes from fixing your thoughts on
                            good things and being optimistic, I say without Jesus we are fooling ourselves. That void stays.</h6>
                        <h6>Jesus said seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then everything you want personally
                            will be added unto. That was serious. Righteousness means keeping yourselves in alignment with
                            the kingdom, accepting the grace of God. Believing what His Son did for us, and accepting his
                            forgiveness of our sins. We no longer need to do anything to be accepted or forgiven. Don't do
                            anything the kingdom consider wrong. Seek the kingdom of God means you invest your time and money
                            to study it, to want to know, having thirst of knowing the mysteries of the kingdom and then
                            you enter it. To stay within is simply your fixing your thoughts on whatever things are true,
                            honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, if there be any virtue and Praise, think on these
                            things. Things you learnt, received and heard and seen in Jesus, do it and the God of peace shall
                            be with you.

                        </h6>
                        <h6>Philippians 4:8-9. That's how we stay in the kingdom seeking it which brings contentment. That's
                            what Job had when he praised God after things and his children were gone, that's what three young
                            men in Babylon had when they said we don't care of the fierce fire, that's what Paul and Silas
                            had when they chose to sing while chained and that's what early Christians had when they accepted
                            to be beaten, confiscated of their goods and dying left to hungry lions in arenas of Roma or
                            burnt in public squares because of their Faith. Do you want to know what they had? Joshua 1:8-9,
                            Matthew 7:7-8</h6>
